## Overview

Mota is an iOS application that allows users to quickly create, modify and share workouts using a built-in exercise bank. The app uses the most modern developement approaches available for user interface (**SwiftUI**), data persistence (**SwiftData**), data management (**@Observable**, **@Bindable**, **@Environment**), architecture (**MV design pattern**) and testing (**mocks**, **page objects** and **custom test classes**). 

The Model layer is built using a Test-Driven-Development (TDD) approach. User authorization is implemented using Firebase and the login flow is supported by automated UI-tests including both pure UI (independent of authorization service) and full end-to-end tests.  

## Implementation details

### üñ•Ô∏è UI Tests
- **Mocking**: Two types of UI tests have been implemented to validate the app's login flow: pure UI (independent of authorization service) and full end-to-end tests. This is achieved by defining classes for both a real authenication service, using FireBase Auth, and a mock authentication service. Both classes are required to conform to the `AuthenticationService` protocol, and then an `AuthenticationService` object is inserted into the relevant view hierarchies via dependency injection. This approach was chosen so that the navigation logic can be tested independently of the choice of authentication service provider (or availability of internet connection) in order to identify errors that are purely UI based, and to accomodate any future decision to use an alterntive to Firebase. 
- **Page Object Pattern**: The Page Object pattern is used to encapsulate the interactions that a user may perform on each of the screens in the login flow. For example `LoginPageObject` provides a function `typeEmail(_:)` which can be used to simulate a user typing in their email on the login page. UI tests requiring this interaction simply call this function with the arguments relevant to the test at hand. Changes to the Login screen's UI then only require updates in one place ‚Äî the LoginPageObject ‚Äî rather than in every test that interacts with the screen.
- **Custom test classes**: Deployed to implement reusable test logic such as setup and teardown functions that can be inhereted into test subclasses.

### ‚úÖ  Unit Tests
- **SwiftData compatability**: In order to create SwiftData model class instances and perform operations on them, a mock Model Container is created "by-hand" and initialized inside each test class. This container is configured such that persistent storage is ephemeral and exists only in memory in order to prevent objects created during testing from accumlating on the test device.   
- **TDD**:  The model layer was built using a Test-Driven-Development (TDD) approach. However, only the most important model functionality is unit tested; tests related to the model layer currently achieve a coverage of 40%.

### üìä SwiftData
- **Ordered to-Many Relationships**: In SwiftData, "to-Many" relationships are declared directly using Arrays (not Sets as in Core Data). However, the order of items when the array is created in memory is not preserved when that array is persisted into storage or reloaded. For ordered One-to-Many relationships in the Mota app, creation order is preserved using a computed var that returns the items from the to-Many array sorted by their creation timestamp. This implementation was chosen in preference to using e.g. a doubly-linked list since SwiftUI's `.onMove(peform:)` modifier for reordering List items uses their position in an array for the reordering, rather than directly inserting items into an underlying linked-list.
- **Handling JSON Data**: The exercise bank is stored in JSON format and exercises are decoded into Swift objects using Codable. However, adding the SwiftData `@Model` macro to the `DatabaseExercise` model adds boilerplate code to the model including properties which are not Codable. In general, this means that SwiftData models, that would otherwise be Codable, are not Codeable by default. Therefore, the `DatabaseExercise` model achieves Codeable conformance through custom implementations of `init(from:)` and `encode(to:)`.


### üñåÔ∏è SwiftUI
- **Observation**: Data is managed within Mota using the new Observation feature introduced to SwiftUI in WWDC23. The property wrappers `@Observable`, `@Bindable` and `@Environment` are used to track changes to data models across views and ensure automatic UI updates, to create two-way bindings to model properties, and to retrieve model objects from a view's' environment, respectively.
- **List manipulations**: Reordering and deleting elements in lists is implemented using the `ForEach` modifiers `.onMove(peform:)` and `.onDelete(perform:)`, repsectively.
- **Collapsed representation of SuperSets**: Mota's data model represents `SuperSet` objects in collapsed form (i.e. using a single `ExerciseRound` object to represent all rounds in a `SuperSet`), and the expanded form is set using property setters when the user updates UI elements that represent the collapsed form.  

### üèóÔ∏è MV Architecture
- **Model-View**: This architecture was chosen because it is simpler than MVVM, requires fewer layers, and is the design pattern used by Apple in all of their latest SwiftUI apps. SwiftUI inherently supports state management through its built-in binding mechanisms. The central idea of the MV pattern is to take advantage of that built-in state management and use Views to also serve as View Models. 

### üîë User authorization
- **FireBase Auth**: User authorization is implemented using Firebase Auth. It was chosed because it offers cross platform compatibility (iOS and Android) and support for and easy implementation of additional login methods (e.g. via Googlemail, Facebook, Apple, etc.)
